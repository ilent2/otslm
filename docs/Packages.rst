The toolbox is split into the following packages:

-  `Simple <Simple-Package>`__ includes simple procedural functions for
   generating phase and amplitude patterns.
-  `Iter <Iter-Package>`__ includes iterative methods for generating
   patterns based on a target beam.
-  `Tools <Tools-Package>`__ provides tools for combining beams and
   visualising the output.
-  `Utils <Utils-Package>`__ provides functions not necessarily related
   to pattern generation but things our group has found useful for
   displaying patterns.
-  `Ui <Ui-Package>`__ contains graphical user interfaces for most of
   the functionality in the toolbox. These user interfaces are useful
   for quickly exploring the functionality of the toolbox.
